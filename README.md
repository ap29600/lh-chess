# LH-Chess
A left-chess engine.

## left-chess
Is a chess variant with the following rules:

- Each piece moves as if it were the first piece that is encountered 
moving to the left of it, from the player's perspective.
- If a piece is the first on its row, the search continues by wrapping 
around to the right end of the chessboard (therefore a piece that is alone on a row moves normally)
